# GuessWho
A simple text-based Java implementation of the game "Guess Who".

<hr><br>
I made this Java application for a final project for the course COE528: Object Oriented Engineering Analysis and Design.
<br>
<br> 
This application features:
<ul>
  <li>Input loop for receiving commands.</li>
  <li>Input verification for determining if commands are valid.</li>
  <li>Randomized board of predetermined people for each game.</li>
  <li>Data read from a text file into the game.</li>
  <li>Highscores tracker.</li>
</ul>
